# Smart Alarm BFF

Independent production control-plane service for Smart Alarm. This directory is a sibling of the untouched official `thingsboard-4.3.1.3` source tree.

The service owns product sessions, inventory binding, product roles, idempotency, approvals, notification outbox and audit associations. ThingsBoard remains authoritative for Device entities, telemetry, Alarm, RPC and OTA assignment.

## Production rules

- Start only with HTTPS/TLS upstreams and file-backed or workload-injected secrets.
- Run database migrations as a separate release job before API/worker rollout. The migrator, API and worker use distinct database identities; migration credentials are never mounted into runtime pods.
- Run API, worker and scheduler as separate processes and identities.
- Never mount the Docker socket or persist secrets in the image/database.
- Do not connect to or modify ThingsBoard internal database tables.

Configuration is documented in the parent repository at `deployment/preproduction.env.example`. `python -m smart_alarm_bff.config` validates the environment without printing secret values.

Direct and transitive runtime dependencies are pinned in `requirements.lock`. Production CI should additionally attach hashes/SBOM and sign the built image before promotion; the package index can be overridden with Docker build argument `PIP_INDEX_URL` without changing the lock.

## Commands

```bash
smart-alarm-migrate
smart-alarm-bootstrap-system-user
smart-alarm-bff
smart-alarm-worker
smart-alarm-import-inventory --factory-batch BATCH --hardware-model MODEL inventory_record.json
```

After migrations, `smart-alarm-bootstrap-system-user` verifies an existing ThingsBoard `SYS_ADMIN` with `SMART_ALARM_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME` and `SMART_ALARM_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` (or its `_FILE` variant), then idempotently registers that immutable ThingsBoard User ID with the `SYSTEM_OPERATOR` product role. The password is used only for the verification request and is never written to PostgreSQL or printed. This bootstrap is not self-registration and does not implement SMS delivery or verification codes.

The API exposes `/health`, `/ready` and loopback/protected `/metrics`, plus the initial `/api/v1/session` create/read/logout boundary. A session is created only after the presented ThingsBoard Bearer token is cross-checked against a locally registered ThingsBoard User ID, username, authority, active Product Role and mapped Tenant/Customer scope. Email is optional contact data and is not a login identity. The platform token is retained only as an AES-GCM envelope; the browser receives an HttpOnly/Secure cookie and a CSRF token. `SYS_ADMIN` deliberately has no Tenant or Customer scope; Tenant and Customer authorities must have both mappings present.

The first scoped directory routes are now available for Customer, Asset, Entity Group, Device Profile, managed-device and system Tenant/User/Role reads. Each query applies `smart_alarm.tenant_id` inside a transaction and also carries an explicit Customer predicate; RLS remains an independent backstop. Tenant, Customer, Customer-member, Asset, Device Profile and Entity Group lifecycle writes use the same session/CSRF boundary, idempotency record and append-only audit transaction. Account creation synchronously creates and activates the official ThingsBoard user because its one-time initial password must never enter PostgreSQL, the outbox or logs. The same request persists the ThingsBoard User ID and compatible Product Role; enable, disable and delete operations are mirrored to ThingsBoard credentials before the local identity state changes. SMS delivery, verification-code validation and self-registration are deliberately outside this development-stage flow. Device Profile type/transport metadata is persisted by a forward migration rather than reconstructed in the browser. Device registration validates the immutable inventory UUID, serial number and one-time claim proof before it creates an `ACTIVATING` product record. Registration, metadata synchronization and retirement return a durable `QUEUED` operation and publish an outbox request; they do not claim that the ThingsBoard side effect has completed. System scope is explicit: system portal transactions enable it only for a `SYS_ADMIN` principal, while session identity resolution uses it internally for one transaction-local lookup by immutable ThingsBoard User ID or session digest. It is released before any ThingsBoard network call and is never derived from a browser-supplied Tenant or Customer ID.

Local integration evidence on 2026-07-24 covers all three authority levels. The `CUSTOMER_USER` login returns the registered `CUSTOMER_OPERATOR` role and exact mapped Tenant/Customer UUIDs under forced Customer RLS. A Tenant Admin also completed Customer create, rename and archive through the BFF, with each operation mirrored to ThingsBoard and the disposable test Customer removed afterward. These loopback checks are `PASS (LOCAL)` only; they do not replace HTTPS, multi-Tenant authorization or production recovery acceptance.

The outbox worker kernel claims due rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, increments a monotonic fencing token, bounds handler execution below the lease, retries with capped exponential backoff, dead-letters permanent/exhausted work and drains an already claimed batch during graceful shutdown. The ThingsBoard 4.3.1.3 administration adapter logs in with a per-Tenant service identity, verifies its authority and Tenant scope, and uses the official Device, credential, Customer assignment and Entity Relation APIs. Device access tokens are generated into an AES-256-GCM file store through atomic, symlink-resistant writes and the database keeps only a versioned reference. A mounted-secret provider resolves only `mounted:` references below an immutable root and never stores returned secret values.

The device activation API now exchanges the immutable device UUID, serial number and factory claim proof for a one-time grant generated by the lifecycle worker. The browser never receives the ThingsBoard access token. Before acknowledgement, an identical proof can retrieve the same encrypted credential to recover from a lost HTTP response; acknowledgement atomically consumes the grant, moves the device from `ACTIVATING` to `ACTIVE` and completes the original registration operation. After acknowledgement, the API returns activation status without credentials. Missing devices, invalid proofs, expired grants and unavailable lifecycle states share an opaque response. The API and worker must mount the same device-secret volume and 32-byte encryption key.

Concrete lifecycle handlers create the official ThingsBoard Device and ACCESS_TOKEN, synchronize Customer assignment and Asset Relation metadata, and retire a device by rotating its platform credential before any local success is recorded. Retirement retains the ThingsBoard Device ID for telemetry and Alarm history, removes the encrypted old Token and revokes activation grants. Every local completion checks the outbox event ID, worker owner, monotonic fencing token and unexpired lease in the same transaction. Retryable platform failures preserve the transition state for exponential retry; permanent failures move the operation and lifecycle into explicit failed states before dead-lettering. `smart-alarm-worker` registers only the three supported lifecycle events, uses the independent worker database identity, exports loopback Prometheus metrics and drains its claimed batch on SIGTERM/SIGINT before closing PostgreSQL and ThingsBoard clients.

For local development, `deployment/thingsboard/local/tb-local.sh bff-start` starts the API and worker together. The worker metrics endpoint is bound only to `127.0.0.1:9464`. Tenant service-identity JSON files are supplied through the read-only `smart-alarm-service-identities` volume; credentials must never be committed to this repository. Run `scripts/check.sh` to compile and execute the test suite; it uses `.venv/bin/python` when available or accepts an explicit `PYTHON` path.

Factory inventory is imported offline with `smart-alarm-import-inventory` under a dedicated database identity that can access only `device_inventory`. The importer accepts only canonical, unused simulator factory records with mode `0600`, validates the UUIDv4, serial, technical name, SHA-256 claim digest and unexpired timestamps, and is idempotent only when every stored field is identical. It never accepts or prints the plaintext claim token and never overwrites claimed or conflicting inventory.

Business routes are added behind the same cookie session boundary. Readiness remains false until PostgreSQL, Valkey, ThingsBoard and OIDC discovery are reachable. Valkey is the only supported cache service; the pinned Python `redis` package is used solely as its RESP client driver.
