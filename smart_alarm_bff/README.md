# Smart Alarm BFF

Independent production control-plane service for Smart Alarm. This directory is a sibling of the untouched official `thingsboard-4.3.1.3` source tree.

The service owns product sessions, inventory binding, product roles, idempotency, approvals, notification outbox and audit associations. ThingsBoard remains authoritative for Device entities, telemetry, Alarm, RPC and OTA assignment.

## Production rules

- Start only with HTTPS/TLS upstreams and file-backed or workload-injected secrets.
- Run database migrations as a separate release job before API/worker rollout. The migrator, API and worker use distinct database identities; migration credentials are never mounted into runtime pods.
- Run API, worker and scheduler as separate processes and identities.
- Never mount the Docker socket or persist secrets in the image/database.
- Do not connect to or modify ThingsBoard internal database tables.

Configuration is documented in the parent repository at `deployment/preproduction.env.example`. `python -m smart_alarm_bff.config` validates the environment without printing secret values.

Direct and transitive runtime dependencies are pinned in `requirements.lock`. Production CI should additionally attach hashes/SBOM and sign the built image before promotion; the package index can be overridden with Docker build argument `PIP_INDEX_URL` without changing the lock.

## Commands

```bash
smart-alarm-migrate
smart-alarm-bff
```

The API exposes `/health`, `/ready` and loopback/protected `/metrics`, plus the initial `/api/v1/session` create/read/logout boundary. A session is created only after the presented ThingsBoard Bearer token is cross-checked against a locally registered user, an active Product Role and the mapped Tenant/Customer scope. The platform token is retained only as an AES-GCM envelope; the browser receives an HttpOnly/Secure cookie and a CSRF token. `SYS_ADMIN` deliberately has no Tenant or Customer scope; Tenant and Customer authorities must have both mappings present.

Business routes are added behind the same cookie session boundary. Readiness remains false until PostgreSQL, Redis, ThingsBoard and OIDC discovery are reachable.
